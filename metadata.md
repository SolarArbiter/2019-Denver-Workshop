Create new Sites, Observations, Forecasts
=========================================

The Solar Forecast Arbiter organizes metadata into Sites, Observations, and Forecasts.

We recommend following the steps outlined [here](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/dashboarddoc/) to explore the process of creating new sites, observations, and forecasts.

Make up some inputs that seem reasonable (maybe for your home town). Let us know if the system accepts any inputs that are unreasonable.

Don't worry about creating and deleting any of this metadata -- we'll reset the system at the end of the workshop!

The [Upload and download data](upload_download_data.md) tutorial provides a bit more guidance and sample files for that topic. It will suggest that you create a GHI Observation with 60 minute interval length data.

A detailed description of the data model is available [here](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/datamodel/).
