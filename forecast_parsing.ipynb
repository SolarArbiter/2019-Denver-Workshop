    "# Forecast run parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solar Forecast Arbiter is designed to analyze *non-overlapping* forecasts. The [documentation](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/definitions/) details the motivation for this choice. Briefly, this forces forecast users and providers to think carefully about what kinds of forecasts they want to analyze. Ideally, these choices will be informed by one or more decision-making processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast providers often design systems that create many overlapping forecasts. For example, new forecasts may be issued once per hour and extend for 48 hours. In some systems, the raw forecasts may also have a higher temporal resolution than the end-user application requires. Providers or end users need to parse these forecasts by parameters such as lead time before they can be analyzed. Similarly, these forecast runs must be parsed into one or more non-overlapping \"forecast evaluation time series\" before they can be uploaded to the Solar Forecast Arbiter. The figure below illustrates this situation. It shows three forecast runs (green) issued 1 hour apart, each with 15 minute intervals and a length of 3 hours. These forecast runs are sliced, resampled, and concatenated into two different forecast evaluation time series: a 1 hour ahead, 15 minute interval forecast (blue); and a 2 hour ahead, 1 hour interval forecast (red).\n",
